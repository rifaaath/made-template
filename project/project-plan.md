# Project Plan

## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Educational Access and Economic Mobility in the Americas.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does educational access influence economic mobility in various regions across the Americas?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
Access to education and economic mobility are considered vital, since unequal educational outcomes could lead to economic inequality perpetuating from generation to generation. The project investigates the correlations between educational access, which is defined as literacy rates in higher levels of education, and economic mobility, defined as income and employment rates, in the Americas through correlation analysis using data. From the available datasets from the World Bank and the European Data Portal, we try to find out whether higher accessibility of educational attainment can mean better economic performance for North, Central, and South America.

The implication of such results will provide insight into how these inequalities in education may influence economic mobility and should therefore probably guide the course of policies for the reduction of inequality and achievement of equitable growth.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

### Datasource1: World Bank Open Data - Education Statistics
* Metadata URL: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRR
* Data URL: https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/SE.PRM.ENRR?downloadformat=csv
* Data Type: CSV

This is an education statistics dataset for many countries that includes total enrollment rates at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, and overall literacy rates. It may be useful for assessing the level of access to education across countries in the Americas.

### Datasource2: World Bank Open Data - Economic Indicators
* Metadata URL: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD
* Data URL: https://api.worldbank.org/v2/en/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?downloadformat=csv
* Data Type: CSV

This dataset includes a wide range of economic indicators, such as GDP per capita, income levels, and employment rates for countries globally. It will help measure economic outcomes and mobility indicators across countries in North, Central, and South America, allowing for analysis in relation to education data.
